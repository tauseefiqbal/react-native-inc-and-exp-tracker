## Features

### Authentication & User Management
- ✅ **Email & Password Authentication**: Secure user registration and login powered by Firebase Authentication (`signInWithEmailAndPassword` and `createUserWithEmailAndPassword`).
- ✅ **Persistent Auth Session**: Automatic session state persistence across app restarts using `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` and `onAuthStateChanged`.
- ✅ **Protected Route Navigation**: Automatic redirection between `(auth)` welcome/login/register screens and `(tabs)` main application screens via Expo Router.
- ✅ **Customizable User Profiles**: Update display name and upload a custom profile avatar from the device gallery.

### Multi-Wallet Management
- ✅ **Unlimited Custom Wallets**: Create multiple wallets (e.g., Main Cash, Bank Account, Salary, Savings) with custom icons/images.
- ✅ **Aggregated Total Balance**: Real-time calculation of overall net balance, total income, and total expenses across all user wallets on the Home card and Wallet tab.
- ✅ **Automatic Wallet Balance Synchronization**: Creating, editing, or deleting a transaction automatically recalculates and updates the linked wallet's `amount`, `totalIncome`, and `totalExpenses`.
- ✅ **Cascading Wallet Deletion**: Deleting a wallet automatically batch-deletes all associated transactions in Firestore to maintain data integrity.
- ✅ **Overdraft Protection**: Prevents recording or updating expenses that exceed the selected wallet's available balance.

### Income & Expense Tracking
- ✅ **12 Predefined Expense Categories**: Categorize spending across Groceries, Rent, Utilities, Transportation, Entertainment, Dining, Health, Insurance, Savings, Clothing, Personal, and Others—each with distinct Phosphor icons and color badges.
- ✅ **Dedicated Income Logging**: Log income entries directly into any wallet with automatic balance crediting.
- ✅ **Receipt Image Attachments**: Attach optional receipt or invoice photos to any transaction using the device image picker and Cloudinary upload pipeline.
- ✅ **Cross-Platform Date Picker**: Select transaction dates seamlessly using native Android/iOS date pickers (`@react-native-community/datetimepicker`).
- ✅ **Full Transaction CRUD**: View, edit, or delete existing transactions; changing transaction type, amount, or wallet automatically reverts old wallet balances and applies new ones.

### Analytics & Interactive Statistics
- ✅ **Weekly Financial Analytics**: Grouped bar charts comparing daily income vs. expenses over the last 7 days.
- ✅ **Monthly Financial Analytics**: Grouped bar charts displaying month-by-month income and expense totals over the last 12 months.
- ✅ **Yearly Financial Analytics**: Multi-year bar chart aggregation from the user's earliest recorded transaction year to the current year.
- ✅ **Filtered Period Transaction List**: Displays the corresponding transactions list directly below the active Weekly, Monthly, or Yearly chart.

### Real-Time Search & Filtering
- ✅ **Instant Keyword Search**: Dedicated search modal (`/(modals)/searchModal`) that filters transactions in real time by category, transaction type (`income` / `expense`), or description keywords.
- ✅ **Live Firestore Subscriptions**: Custom `useFetchData` hook built on Firestore `onSnapshot` listeners for instant UI updates without manual refreshing.

### Cloud Media & Cross-Platform UI
- ✅ **Cloudinary Unsigned Image Uploads**: Automatic cloud hosting for user avatars, wallet icons, and transaction receipts organized into dedicated Cloudinary folders (`users`, `wallets`, `transactions`).
- ✅ **Smooth Animations & Transitions**: Fluid screen and list entry animations powered by `react-native-reanimated` (`FadeInDown` spring animations).
- ✅ **Responsive Scaling**: Adaptive layout scaling across phones, tablets, and web viewports using custom `scale` and `verticalScale` utilities.

## Deployment

### App Live URL (APP URL)
- **Live Web / App URL (`APP URL`)**: `https://expense-tracker-app.expo.app` *(Replace with your production Vercel / Netlify / EAS Hosting URL once deployed)*
- **Expo Project Slug**: `expense-tracker-app`
- **Android Package ID**: `com.tauseefiqbal.expensetrackerapp`
- **EAS Project ID**: `c0809b04-ee4e-40ee-b5dd-142bb6cb1ddf`

### EAS Mobile Builds (Android & iOS)
The project includes preconfigured profiles in [`eas.json`](file:///e:/CRTST/MOBILE-APPS/WORKON/react-native-inc_and_exp_tracker/eas.json):

```bash
# Install EAS CLI globally
npm install -g eas-cli

# Log in to your Expo account
eas login

# Build internal Android APK (Preview profile)
eas build -p android --profile preview

# Build production Android App Bundle (AAB) or iOS archive
eas build --platform all --profile production
```

### Web Static Deployment
Because `app.json` configures `"web": { "bundler": "metro", "output": "static" }`, you can export and deploy the web bundle to EAS Hosting, Vercel, or Netlify:

```bash
# Export static web build to the dist/ folder
npx expo export --platform web

# Deploy to EAS Hosting
eas deploy
```

## Test and Admin Users Credentials

> [!NOTE]
> The app uses Firebase Email/Password Authentication. You can sign in using the pre-configured test credentials below, register a new account directly from the Sign-Up screen, or seed the demo database documents using [`scripts/seedDatabase.js`](file:///e:/CRTST/MOBILE-APPS/WORKON/react-native-inc_and_exp_tracker/scripts/seedDatabase.js).

### Regular Test User Credentials
| Field | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Role** | Regular User |
| **Name** | Demo User |
| **Email** | `demo@expensetracker.app` |
| **Password** | `Demo@12345` *(or create via Register screen if testing on a fresh Firebase instance)* |
| **Sample Wallet** | `Main Cash Wallet` (`$1,500.00` balance) |

### Admin / Demo Seeded User Credentials
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Administrative operations (database seeding, security rule deployment, and user management) are performed via the Firebase Console and the Node.js Admin/Seed CLI rather than a separate in-app role, as Firestore rules strictly isolate user data (`request.auth.uid == userId`).

| Field | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Role** | Admin / Project Owner (Firebase & Cloudinary Console + Seed Script) |
| **Admin Test Email** | `admin@expensetracker.app` |
| **Admin Test Password** | `Admin@12345` |
| **Seeded UID** | `sample_user_01` |
| **Seeded Wallet ID** | `sample_wallet_01` (`Main Cash Wallet`) |
| **Seeded Transaction ID** | `sample_transaction_01` (`Groceries - $45.50`) |

---

## How to Use App for Regular User

### 1. Account Registration & Sign In
1. Launch the app to view the **Welcome Screen** (`/(auth)/welcome`).
2. Tap **Get Started** to open the **Sign Up** screen (`/(auth)/register`) and create an account with your **Name**, **Email**, and **Password**, or tap **Login** (`/(auth)/login`) if you already have an account.
3. Upon successful authentication, you are automatically redirected to the **Home Dashboard** (`/(tabs)`).

### 2. Creating & Managing Wallets
1. Navigate to the **Wallet** tab (`/(tabs)/wallet`) from the bottom navigation bar.
2. Tap the green **Plus (`+`)** icon next to **My Wallets** to open the **New Wallet Modal** (`/(modals)/walletModal`).
3. Enter a **Wallet Name** (e.g., *Salary*, *Main Cash*, *Savings*) and upload a **Wallet Icon** image from your device.
4. Tap **Add Wallet**. Your new wallet appears in the list with an initial balance of `$0.00`.
5. To edit or delete an existing wallet, tap on the wallet item in the list, modify its name/icon or tap the red **Trash** button (deleting a wallet also removes all transactions linked to it).

### 3. Recording Income & Expenses
1. On the **Home** tab (`/(tabs)/index`), tap the floating green **Plus (`+`)** button in the bottom-right corner to open the **Add Transaction Modal** (`/(modals)/transactionModal`).
2. Select the **Type**:
   - **Income**: Adds funds to the chosen wallet.
   - **Expense**: Deducts funds from the chosen wallet (requires sufficient wallet balance).
3. Select the target **Wallet** from the dropdown (displays current wallet balance next to its name).
4. If recording an **Expense**, choose an **Expense Category** (e.g., *Groceries*, *Rent*, *Dining*, *Utilities*, etc.).
5. Pick the **Date** of the transaction, enter the numeric **Amount**, and optionally provide a **Description** and upload a **Receipt Image**.
6. Tap **Submit**. The Home card and recent transactions list update immediately in real time.

### 4. Searching & Updating Transactions
1. Tap the **Magnifying Glass** icon in the top-right corner of the **Home** screen to open the **Search Modal** (`/(modals)/searchModal`).
2. Type at least 2 characters to filter transactions instantaneously by **category**, **type** (`income`/`expense`), or **description**.
3. Tap any transaction item in the Home, Statistics, or Search list to open it in the **Update Transaction Modal**, where you can modify details or delete the transaction.

### 5. Viewing Financial Statistics
1. Open the **Statistics** tab (`/(tabs)/statistics`) from the bottom navigation bar.
2. Switch between **Weekly**, **Monthly**, and **Yearly** views using the segmented control at the top.
3. Inspect the dual-bar chart (**Green** bars represent Income; **Rose/Red** bars represent Expenses) and scroll down to review all transactions within that timeframe.

### 6. Managing User Profile
1. Open the **Profile** tab (`/(tabs)/profile`).
2. Tap **Edit Profile** to open the **Profile Modal** (`/(modals)/profileModal`).
3. Tap the pencil icon on your avatar to pick a new photo from your gallery, update your **Name**, and tap **Update**.

## How to Use App for Admin User

### 1. Seeding Initial Database Collections
Admins and developers can initialize or reset sample documents in the Firestore collections (`users`, `wallets`, `transactions`) using the included seed script [`scripts/seedDatabase.js`](file:///e:/CRTST/MOBILE-APPS/WORKON/react-native-inc_and_exp_tracker/scripts/seedDatabase.js):

```bash
node scripts/seedDatabase.js
```

This creates:
- `users/sample_user_01` (`Demo User`, `demo@expensetracker.app`)
- `wallets/sample_wallet_01` (`Main Cash Wallet` with `amount: 1500`, `totalIncome: 2000`, `totalExpenses: 500`)
- `transactions/sample_transaction_01` (`expense` of `$45.50` in `groceries`)

### 2. Managing Firestore Security Rules & Indexes
Firestore security rules ([`firestore.rules`](file:///e:/CRTST/MOBILE-APPS/WORKON/react-native-inc_and_exp_tracker/firestore.rules)) and composite indexes ([`firestore.indexes.json`](file:///e:/CRTST/MOBILE-APPS/WORKON/react-native-inc_and_exp_tracker/firestore.indexes.json)) are maintained at the project root.
- Deploy updated security rules and composite indexes via Firebase CLI:
  ```bash
  firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,firestore:indexes
  ```
- Deploy storage rules ([`storage.rules`](file:///e:/CRTST/MOBILE-APPS/WORKON/react-native-inc_and_exp_tracker/storage.rules)) if using Firebase Storage alongside Cloudinary:
  ```bash
  firebase deploy --only storage
  ```

### 3. Managing Users & Data via Firebase Console
1. Sign in to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Open **Authentication > Users** to reset user passwords, disable compromised accounts, or manually add test/admin accounts.
3. Open **Firestore Database > Data** to inspect or audit `users`, `wallets`, and `transactions` documents across all UIDs.

### 4. Managing Media Assets in Cloudinary
1. Sign in to the [Cloudinary Console](https://console.cloudinary.com/).
2. Navigate to **Media Library** to review uploaded images organized under the `users/`, `wallets/`, and `transactions/` folders.
3. Navigate to **Settings > Upload > Upload Presets** to manage unsigned upload presets, file size restrictions, or allowed image formats.
